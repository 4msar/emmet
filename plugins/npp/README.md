## Changing keyboard shortcuts

Open `keymap.json` file of this plugin and edit shortcuts for Emmet actions. When finished, restart Notepad++
 
## Extending Emmet

You can create *emmet-extensions* folder in Notepadâ€™s plugins folder and put Emmet extensions there. All files with `.js` extension will be loaded automatically on editor start. Also, you can place `snippets.json` with your custom snippets (similar to bundled *jN\includes\snippets.json* file) and `preferences.json` with custom modules preferences.
 
## Kudos
 
Emmet for Notepad++ is based on jN plugin by sieukrem:

This plugin allows you to extend Notepad++ with JavaScript. You can write your own scripts and put them
in 'includes' folder of this plugin.
