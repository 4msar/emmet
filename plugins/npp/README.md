## Changing keyboard shortcuts

## Extending Zen Coding

You can create *zencoding-extensions* folder in Notepadâ€™s plugins folder and put Zen Coding extensions there. All files with `.js` extension will be loaded automatically on editor start. Also, you can place `snippets.json` with your custom snippets (similar to bundled *jN\includes\snippets.json* file) and `preferences.json` with custom modules preferences.
